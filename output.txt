4. THEORETICAL vs EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

Algorithm Complexity Analysis:
Algorithm                 | Theoretical Time    | Theoretical Space | Empirical Performance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Counting Sort (Non-Stable) |             O(810) |            O(802) |                 8 μs
    Counting Sort (Stable) |             O(810) |            O(810) |                 2 μs
          Radix Sort (LSD) |              O(54) |             O(18) |                15 μs
               Bucket Sort |     O(810) average |            O(810) |                 6 μs
